================ BACKGROUND

These programs are quick hacks which will let you play around with the WPS
object creation. Note that you can get yourself into trouble with these;
the system will let you make duplicate clocks, etc. which may be hard to
get rid of, and I can't take any responsibility for your use of them.
As with any program, you should read the source code before you use them
if you're concerned about what they do.

================ GETTING YOUR CLOCK BACK

To get your clock back into the System Setup folder, use MAKEOBJ like this:

    MAKEOBJ WPClock "System Clock" "<WP_CONFIG>"

This will create a new clock in the System Setup folder, just like the
original one.

Don't run this more than once, or you'll end up with too many clocks
(see next section). These can be hard to get rid of and can confuse the
system, which expects to have only one.

================ GETTING RID OF PESKY EXTRA CLOCKS

I wrote these programs to experiment with the WPS object functions,
and to get my System Clock back. I promptly made too many clocks and
had to go through the following to get rid of them:

(from command prompt)
    mkdir c:\xyz

(go to WP Shell, then:)
    open new folder c:\xyz from Drives
    move extra clocks into this folder
    close the folder

(from command prompt)
    rmdir c:\xyz

=============== THE PROGRAMS

There are four executable files here:

============== MAKEOBJ.EXE

      usage:    MAKEOBJ Classname Title Location [SetupString]

This creates a new Workplace Shell object (even new folders).
See below for Classname, Location, and (optional) SetupString arguments.

Examples:
To make a new system clock in the system startup folder:

    MAKEOBJ WPClock "System Clock" "<WP_CONFIG>"

To make a template of a folder and put it on the desktop, using the icon
which resides in c:\icons\xyz.ico
    
    MAKEOBJ WPFolder "My New Folder" "<WP_DESKTOP>" "TEMPLATE=YES,ICON=c:\icons\xyz.ico"

============== MODOBJ.EXE

      usage:    MODOBJ ObjID setupstring

This modifies the attributes of an existing object if it can find it.

ObjID is either an absolute path name or "<WP_xxx>" type location name.
Probably others would work too, but I don't know their syntax.

for SetupString, see below.

============= DESTOBJ.EXE

      usage:    DESTOBJ ObjID

This destroys an object if it can find it. See MODOBJ for OBJID.
Obviously, you can delete things which may be hard to put back. Be careful.

============= ENUMAPP.EXE

      usage:    ENUMAPP

This lists the application/key pairs from both OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI.
The abstract objects (those without pathnames) live in the INI files;
you might be able to learn something from their contents.

=============== WPS LOCATIONS

============ SETUP STRINGS

The setup string is a series of keyword=value pairs, separated by commas.
For instance, if I wanted to make a template for a Folder using the icon
in the file "c:\icons\folder.ico", I would use the setup string:

	"TEMPLATE=YES,ICON=c:\icons\folder.ico,TITLE=My New Folder"
